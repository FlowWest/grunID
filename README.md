# Welcome to `grunID`
### Overview

This package is designed to support the recording and processing of data for genetic identification of Chinook salmon runs. It contains tools to create field sheets for recording data, process those data, analyze machine output determining run type of samples, and upload those results to a database in machine-readable, easily accessible format. The package requires credentials for an Azure database and compatibility with R. 

### Installation

The package can be installed by running the code block below:

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SRJPE/grunID")
```

## Dependencies

The `grunID` package requires data be collected and recorded from Rotary Screw Traps (RSTs) in the template field sheets generated by the package. The functions in `grunID` process data input, genetic analysis output, determine genetic identification of run type, and ensure data are in machine-readable, standard format. From there, these data can be used in juvenile monitoring and life cycle modeling, as well as uploaded to an Azure database where they can be then be accessed for probabilistic length-at-date (PLAD) modeling.


The `grunID` package uses the native pipe operator (`|>`) instead of the tidyverse pipe operator (`%>%`). You will need to have R version 4.1 or later installed on your computer to run this package. You can update to the latest version of R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). You will need to install the [latest version](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) of the `purrr` package.

We recommend updating dependencies, if installed, as prompted upon running
```
remotes::install_github("FlowWest/grunID")
```
